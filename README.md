# CL LAB #

Repository for experiments with Common LISP.

### How to run ###

The `make run` command will stand up a Docker container locally that will execute the `src/app.lisp` script.

To rebuild the `ciel` ([CIEL Is an Extended LISP](https://github.com/ciel-lang/CIEL)) binary, just run `make build`.
